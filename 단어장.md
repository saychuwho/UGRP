- We consider several problems arising in the design process, including training a system to be robust to rare events, testing its performance under different conditions, and debugging failures.
  - robust : a robust system, organization etc is strong and not likely to have problems

- We show how a probabilistic programming language can help address these problems by specifying distributions encoding interesting types of inputs, then sampling these to generate specialized training and test data.
  - distribution : the way in which something exists in different amounts in different parts of an area or group

-  More generally, such languages can be used to write environment models, an essential prerequisite to any formal analysis.
   - prerequisite : something that is necessary before something else can happen or be done

- SCENIC combines concise, readable syntax for spatiotemporal relationships with the ability to declaratively impose hard and soft constraints over the scenario.
  - concise : short, with no unnecessary words

- ML has proved particularly effective at the difficult perceptual tasks (e.g., vision) arising in cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles which operate in heterogeneous, complex physical environments.
  - perceptual : relating to the ability to interpret or become aware of something through the senses. (ex : vision)
  - heterogeneous : diverse in character or content.

- retraining the system until its performance is adequate.
  - adequate : satisfactory or acceptable in quality or quantity.

- synthetically generated data
  - synethetic : Synthetic products are made from artificial substances, often copying a natural product

- higly non-trivial to generate meaningful data
  - trivial : having little value or importance

- representing different input regimes of interest
  - regime : a particular way of operating or organizing a system, an economy, etc

- imperative style
  - imperative : extremely important or urgent

- formal semantics
  - semantic : (of words and language) connected with meaning

- distributions over spatio-temporal configurations of physical objects and agents
  - spatio-temporal : relating to both space and time, or to space-time (= the part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity that adds the idea of time to those of height, depth, and length)

- domain-specific algorithms
  - domain : an area of interest or an area over which a person has control
