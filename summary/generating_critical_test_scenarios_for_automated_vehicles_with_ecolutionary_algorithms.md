## Abstract

- 요약
  - 우리는 solution space를 minimization하는 것을 기반으로 해서 critical scenario를 만들어내는 접근법을 제시한다.
  - scenario parametrization과 automatic determination of relevant parameter interval을 을 만들어냄으로서, 복잡한 시나리오의 중요성을 최적화할 수 있다.
  - evolutionary algorithm을 이용해 highly nonlinear optimization problem을 다룬다.
  - 이전 우리의 접근과는 다르게, 우리는 이제 복잡한 상황을 다룰 수 있다. 
  - 처음에는 critical하지 않은 시나리오에서 critical한 시나리오를 만들어내는 접근법을 demonstrate한다.
- 모르는 단어
  - feasible : able to be made, done, or achieved.
  - solution space : the "solution space" refers to the set of all possible solutions to a given problem. In the context of autonomous vehicles, the solution space could refer to the set of all possible vehicle behaviors or decisions that could be taken in response to a given set of driving conditions or scenarios. (chatGPT)
  - parametirzation : Parametrization refers to the process of representing a complex system or problem in terms of a set of parameters or variables. In the context of autonomous vehicles, parametrization might involve representing a driving scenario in terms of a set of parameters, such as the vehicle's speed, the position of other vehicles on the road, the road conditions, and so on. (chatGPT)
  - formulate : to develop all the details of a plan for doing something.
  - optimization problem : An optimization problem is a mathematical problem where the goal is to find the best solution from among a set of possible solutions, based on some defined criteria. The "best" solution is often defined in terms of an objective function, which assigns a value to each possible solution, and the goal is to find the solution with the maximum or minimum value of this function. In the context of autonomous vehicles, optimization problems can arise in many areas of the vehicle's design and operation.(chatGPT)
  - evolutionary algorithm : An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a type of optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection in biology. It is used to solve optimization problems where finding the best solution from among a large number of possibilities is computationally difficult or infeasible. <br> The basic idea behind an evolutionary algorithm is to generate a population of candidate solutions to a problem, and then iteratively apply a set of rules to modify and evolve the population over multiple generations. The rules are designed to mimic the process of natural selection, such that the solutions that are better adapted to the problem environment are more likely to survive and be selected for reproduction, while less fit solutions are discarded. The process is repeated over multiple generations until a satisfactory solution is found or a stopping criterion is met.(chatGPT)
