## Q&A

What is the difference between DRIVE Sim and DRIVE Replicator?

DRIVE Sim is NVIDIA's solution for end-to-end closed-loop simulation. DRIVE Sim generates physically accurate synthetic sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, ultrasonic, etc.) which are then fed to the AV stack. The AV stack can either run on the in-vehicle target hardware (Hardware-in-the-Loop) or it can run on generic compute resources (Software-in-the-Loop). DRIVE Sim main use-case is validating whether the AV Stack functions correctly in a wide range of traffic scenarios. DRIVE Replicator is a module within the DRIVE Sim platform, specifically meant for Synthetic Data Generation (SDG). This is an open-loop process, so there is no AV Stack in the loop. The synthetic sensor data generated by DRIVE Replicator comes with Ground-Truth (GT) data. This data can then be used for training neural networks, either using a mix of synthetic data and real data or 100% synthetic data.

What are the advantages of using DRIVE Sim instead of using an open source simulator like CARLA?

DRIVE Sim is unique in the industry in the sense that it is an truly open platform with a wide set of APIs to connect other simulators as well as models for sensors, vehicle dynamics, traffic, etc. There is a rich ecosystem of partners who have built interfaces and connectors with DRIVE Sim, among which CARLA. Also, in contrast to many other AV simulators, DRIVE Sim is NOT based on gaming engine technology. Gaming engines are fundamentally unsuitable for physics based sensor simulation in terms of accuracy, determinism, reproducibility, cloud deployment capabilities, multi-node and multi-sensor capabilities, etc. Rather, DRIVE Sim is based on Omniverse, NVIDIA's physically accurate simulation & collaboration platform.

What kind of debugging methods are available within the Nvidia Drive Sim? What should one do if they dont have an access to local powerful GPU's , can we ask for an access to cloud version? if Yes, then how can we access it? What is the detailed step by step order of the actions?

DRIVE Sim is hardware agnostic which means it can be deployed anywhere: on local workstations, on-prem servers, in a COLO or in the cloud. You can also use it in "hybrid mode" which means that you mix various compute resources to run all your DRIVE Sim workloads.

i'm interested to know how the Synthetic data was generated, is that you already have the 3D models of different car models, or you have to create the 3D models from scratch?

DRIVE Sim comes "out-of-the-box" with a set of sample environments as well as a collection of individual 3D assets such as vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, vegetation, etc. There are also tools to create or import your own 3D content. Last but not least, there is a large partner ecosystem that has created content for DRIVE Sim in "SimReady format" which means that these assets comply to all our requirements for physically accurate simulation.

May i know other than the Drive Sim, what other industry that Nvidia has already has the project / product ready for use , like the "out of the box" you mentioned, for example for railway industry?

DRIVE Sim is an application built on the NVIDIA Omniverse simulation platform. DRIVE Sim is specifically aimed at Autonomous Vehicle simulation, but there are many other applications based on Omniverse. One example is ISAAC Sim which is dedicated to simulation of robotic applications. We have also developed a car configurator based on Omniverse. So far, there is no dedicated railway/train simulator available, but customers like Deutsche Bahn have used Omniverse to create Digital Twins of railways, passengers and run simulations.
