# DeepTrailerAssist: Deep Learning based trailer detection, tracking and articulation angle estimation on automotive rear-view camera

- Abstract : *Using our proprietary dataset comprising of 11
different trailer types, we achieve a reasonable detection ac-
curacy using a lightweight real-time network running at 30
fps on a low power embedded system. The dataset will be
released as a companion to our recently published dataset to encourage further research in this area.*
- Introduction : *we focus on trailer assist use cases and its associated visual perception algorithms.*
- 종합 : visual perception algorithms을 이용해 trailer에서 발생할 수 있는 scenario들을 해결하는 방안과 dataset들을 만드는 논문
