  - Intro 속 Summary
    - SCENIC, a domain-specific probabilistic programming language for describing scenarios: distributions over spatio-temporal configurations of physical objects and agents;
    - a methodology for using PPLs to design and analyze cyber-physical systems, especially those based on ML;
    - domain-specific algorithms for sampling from the distribution defined by a SCENIC program;
    - a case study using SCENIC to analyze and improve the accuracy of a practical deep neural network used for perception in an autonomous driving context beyond what is achieved by state-of-the-art synthetic data generation methods.

- Formal Specification
  - In computer science, formal specifications are mathematically based techniques whose purpose are to help with the implementation of systems and software. They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools.( [WIKIPEDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification) )
